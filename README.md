- unplug the USB from your computer, wait 3 seconds
- replug the USB back into your computer, wait 5 seconds
- upload your code from the Arduino IDE

##Misc Notes

##Notes on test modules*

###Controller side
1 - this is the one i resoldered the signal yellow cable, that came off
2 - upload not working, and converted #1 was getting very hot when connected to this one
3 - this is the one that works that has the latest software on it

###Converter Side
1 - getting VERY HOT to the touch, but only when connected to controller #2
2 - this one i removed the 5v converter from, and am feeding it 5v directly from the power supply
